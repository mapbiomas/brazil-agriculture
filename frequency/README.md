## About

This repository contains the scripts used to make the frequency maps for MapBiomas' Agriculture module.

We recommend that you read the [Agriculture Appendix of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds), since important informations about the methodology can be found in there. For this beta version, we are making available the script to proccess the crop frequency of temporary crops at pixel scale.
