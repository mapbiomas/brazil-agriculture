## About
This repository contains scripts used for the classification of Mapbiomas' 10m Collection 2 Beta agriculture classes. We recommend that you read the  [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds), since important informations about the classification methodology can be found there. For this collection, we have the following agriculture classes:

 - Temporary Crop
 - Perennial Crop
