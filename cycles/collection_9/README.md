## About

This repository contains the scripts used to make the number of cycles maps for MapBiomas' Agriculture module.

We recommend that you read the [Agriculture Appendix of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD)](https://mapbiomas.org/download-dos-atbds), since important informations about the methodology can be found in there. For this beta version, we are making available the script to proccess the number of crop cycles of temporary crops at pixel scale.

## How to use

You can follow the instructions in the link bellow:
